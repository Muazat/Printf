# Printf
The my_printf() function produce output on stdout according to a given format. You are expected to pass a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are outputed. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not PERCENT), which are copied unchanged to the output stream and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversions are represented by %. The works takes int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted to signed decimal (d). unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned hexadecimal (x). c The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written. s The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character. p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
